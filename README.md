Air Quality Monitoring System using ESP32

Overview
This project is an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring System that measures the concentration of harmful gases (CO, CO₂, NH₃, LPG, etc.) in the environment using gas sensors. The ESP32 microcontroller is used to collect sensor data and display it on an OLED screen. It can also send data to the cloud via Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.

Objectives
* Monitor air quality in real time.
* Detect harmful gases and provide alerts.
* Display sensor data on an OLED screen.
* Enable IoT connectivity using ESP32.

Components Used
*ESP32 Development Board
* MQ Series Gas Sensor (e.g., MQ-135)
* OLED Display (SSD1306)
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* USB Cable
* (Optional) Buzzer for alert system

System Architecture
1. Gas sensor detects the concentration of gases.
2.  ESP32 reads sensor values.
3. Data is displayed on the OLED screen.
4. Optionally, data is sent to the cloud for IoT applications.

Working Principle
* The MQ sensor changes its resistance when exposed to specific gases.
* The ESP32 converts the analog signal into digital data.
* Readings are displayed on the OLED screen.
* If connected to Wi-Fi, data can be uploaded to cloud services such as Thingspeak or Blynk.

Applications
* Indoor air quality monitoring.
* Pollution detection in cities.
* Industrial safety monitoring.
* Smart home automation.

Future Enhancements
* Add multiple sensors for temperature and humidity.
* Integrate GPS for location-based monitoring.
* Add mobile app/cloud dashboard.
